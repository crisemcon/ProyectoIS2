## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.<!-- See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. -->


### Prerequisites

- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
- Python3 - [Download & Install Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- MySQL - [Download & Install MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) and make sure it's running on the default port 3306.


### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

First create a virtual environment and activate it. You can use your preffered path:

```
python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/school-contact-tracing 
```

Install the backend dependencies navigating to the backend directory and executing:

```
pip install flask
pip install flask_sqlalchemy   
pip install flask_marshmallow
pip install flask_cors
pip install mysqlclient
```

Install the frontend dependencies navigating ot the frontend directory and executing:
```
npm install
```

Finally create a MySQL database and poblate it with example data. Execute the script.sql file in the database directory. For example, in macOS:

```
mysql -uroot < ./database/script.sql
```

### Running
To run the server application, navigate to the backend folder and run this in the command-line:
```
python3 app.py
```
To run the client application, navigate to the getdo-client folder and run this in another command-line:
```
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

*Notice that you need client and server runs concurrently in different terminal session, in order to make them communicate to each other.*
